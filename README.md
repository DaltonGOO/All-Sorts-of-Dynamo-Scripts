# Intro-to-Parametric-Modeling-Dynamo-Scripts
This repo is a place for Dynamo scripts created based on the Intro to Parametric Modeling series by Jose Luis. The YouTube series looks into parametric modeling, where Jose will teach you the basics of using algorithms for creating three-dimensional geometry in GH. I created followed the series, but instead of GH, I followed along with Dynamo. I learned a lot more about Dynamo because of that but also GH. I welcome anybody to use the scripts, and I hope you learn as much as I did! Not everything has been created yet, but I will continue to add new scripts to the library. I have also added some random scripts that explore computational geometry.
